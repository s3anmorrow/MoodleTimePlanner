DESCRIPTION:Programming Assignment III\nPROG1100 Programming I\n \nEvaluati
	 on : 30% of final grade\nDue Date : Dec 10\n \nAssignment Description\nProg
	 ramming project III will be to design and develop a “choose your own advent
	 ure” story windows application.  In other words\, you will develop a simple
	  interactive story in which the user can make decisions via clicking button
	 s that will affect the overall plot and outcome.\n \nRequirements include:\
	 n\nYour story must contain four points where decisions are to be made. Thes
	 e decision points consist of an image\, some story plot text\, and two stor
	 y option buttons that are labelled accordingly to what your options are in 
	 the story.\nYour story/images can be of whatever you choose – be creative!\
	 nYour story must include three possible endings.\nAll story content must be
	  drawn from an external Access database (plot text\, two story options\, im
	 age filename\, etc.). This means that you can add\, edit\, and delete conte
	 nt in the database and the story should reflect these changes next time the
	  app is executed. Use the provided database (game.accdb) as a template and 
	 edit it to your own story. Note that for testing purposes I will be swappin
	 g out this database with a different one (more records\, different destinat
	 ion points\, etc) to see if the changes are reflected in the story.\nWhen t
	 he game starts up the user should see a blank form except the story name (s
	 tart screen).\nWhen the game is over an image and the final story plot text
	  but no buttons.\nA menu must be included in the game that has five menu it
	 ems:\n\n\nA new game menu item that starts a new game\nA save menu item tha
	 t will save your game in an external text file. This menu item should be di
	 sabled if the game hasn’t actually started (on the start screen) or the gam
	 e is currently over. Only one game can be saved/loaded and thus there is no
	  need to provide the user with open or save dialog popups in this applicati
	 on. Feedback should be displayed to the user when the game has been saved s
	 uccessfully.\nA load menu item that will load a previously saved game. If n
	 o game has been previously saved then this menu item should be disabled.\nA
	 n about menu item which opens a new form. The form should contain additiona
	 l information and an image of the developer. Naturally\, you will want to p
	 rovide a way to close the form\; but also include functionality that will a
	 utomatically close the form if the user clicks anywhere outside of the form
	 .\nA quit menu item that shuts the application down at any time\n\n\nThe en
	 tire windows application must contain only two forms (frmMain / frmAbout)\n
	 All connection\, data adapter\, and dataset objects must be generated via c
	 ode and NOT via the toolbox in visual studio (do it how we did during our l
	 essons)\nThis application must not include any repeated blocks of code (the
	 se should be modularized inside sub or function procedures)\nThis applicati
	 on must include some custom visual design (size\, button size\, fonts\, for
	 m icons\, colors\, etc.) as well as be user-friendly!\nBe sure to include i
	 nformative comments in your code\n\n \n \nSee other side…\nRequirements (Ma
	 rks breakdown)\n\n\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure Game Windows Application\
	 n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nForm visual design\nOverall game functionality\nConnecting 
	 to the database\, population\, displaying content\, well-formed non-redunda
	 nt code\, etc...\nMenu new game functionality\nMenu save game functionality
	 \nMenu load game functionality\nMenu about functionality\nMenu exit functio
	 nality\nComments included\n\n\n1\n16\n \n3\n5\n5\n3\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL MA
	 RK\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \nOther Notes\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with “Choose Yo
	 ur Own Adventure” style stories\, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch
	 oose_Your_Own_Adventure\nRemember to test this application thoroughly to me
	 et all project requirements and to avoid any runtime errors.\nThe images fo
	 r the story are NOT embedded into the database but are kept externally in a
	  directory with the EXE (in the debug folder).  The only data pertaining to
	  the images that is kept in the database is the filenames of the images. Be
	  sure to use copyright free images in your game.\nWhen completed\, zip the 
	 ENTIRE folder of your Visual Basic.NET Project (including the access databa
	 se file (accdb) and the external image files) and email to sean.morrow@nscc
	 .ca by lesson time on the due date. We will mark this project face to face 
	 on the due date.\nSince this assignment is due so close to the last day of 
	 the semester\, no late assignments can be accepted.  \n

SUMMARY:another test assignment
DESCRIPTION:Take control of the inner battle between white blood cells/Anti

	 range of cool techniques for developing games using Actionscript and Adobe 
	 AIR for mobile platforms. Bitmap blitting\, object pooling\, among others w
	 ere employed as well as custom made graphics and sound effects (a lot of ti
	 me spent gurgling in the recording booth). This app was developed for deplo
	 yment on Android tablets/Data Phones...
