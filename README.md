MoodleTimePlanner
=================

A moodlized version of my student time planner.  
Provides a more user friendly calendar of all the user's deadlines in all courses enrolled.  
When a user opens the timeplanner for the first time they will need to be logged into Moodle - however all subsequent times the app will draw the user information from a local cookie on the system.  
Supports user created event deadlines as well.  
App is deployed right inside the moodle course.
